# Device monitor
Project for home assignment - monitor all of your devices!
Available methods:
`start('devices_directory','log_frequency')`

`stop()`

`get_statuses('devices_directory')`

Before using this module define .json files with devices parameters placed in 'devices_directory' folder.
Remember to define one device per one file. The name of the file is then passed to logs so you can see clearly device and its parameters.
