# device_manager
Project for home assignment - monitor all of your devices!
Available methods:
`start('devices_directory','log_frequency')`

`stop()`

`get_statuses('devices_directory')`

Before using this module define .json files with devices parameters (placed in 'devices_directory' folder).
Remember to define one device per one file.
The name of the file is then passed to logs so you can see clearly each device and its parameters.

**For more docs and comments how to use this module please clone the repo and have a look at test script. Methods in module are also quite well described, but if you run into any issues please let me know!**
